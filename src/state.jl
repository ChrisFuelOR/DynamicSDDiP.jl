This struct is used to store the bound and integer information of a state
variable (either .in or .out).
This is required to be able to retrieve this information after fixing/unfixing
the states for regularization or relaxation purposes.

In NCNBD.jl this was done by introducing a struct NCNBD.State with a field
stateInfo, however only for the linearized model. Overwriting the SDDP.State in
general without rewriting a lot of SDDP code does not seem possible.

Set the incoming state variable of the node to the values contained in the

"""
Preparation of fixing a state variable with three different types of argument.

Note that this differentiation is required since we use the term "state" for
different things. One time for the dict of SDDP.States in our model, each
basically containing two variable references (.in and .out).
Another time for a current state (incoming_state, outgoing_state), which is
a specific allocation of values to one of these variables (e.g. representing
the current trial point). This is a Dict{Symbol,Float64} then. The third case
is used for binary approximations of the state space.

The first method with the symbol is used for setting the incoming state, since
there we loop over all states getting the state_name (::Symbol) and the
value (::Float64) from the current state dict (which is the incoming_state_value
dict, actually).

The second method with the SDDP.State is used for resetting the model after
a regularization or a (Lagrangian) relaxation. In this case, we reset the
integer and binary type of the relaxed variables and the bounds and then fix
them again to their originally fixed values.

The third one is used for the binary case.
